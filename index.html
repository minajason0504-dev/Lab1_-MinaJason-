    I'm 18yrs old and I'm turning 19 this August. One of my favorite hobbies is reading because I love getting lost in different stories, discovering new ideas, and learning from the experiences of the characters. I also enjoy crocheting. It helps me make creative items and have fun, like decorations, order because I sell my projects or gifts for my friends and family. In my free time, I listen to music using my phone and spend time with my friends or family. My goal is to finish my studies and have a better future.</p>
